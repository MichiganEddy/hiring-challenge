# A Better Commenting System  
When I'm reading comments on the internet, I get frustrated that there is so little contextual specificity available for them. A two or three page article might have hundreds of specifically commentable snippets of text, any of which might be contradictory, objectionable, laudible, in or out of agreement with the others, or otherwise contextually relevent. Nonetheless, all the comments appear after the piece and they retain few visual cues about where in the piece they are referring.

I therefore propose a better commenting system, which catalogs comments with a reference to a particular text section. Comments then appear alongside the text, and comments on comments expand laterally. Many comments on a specific section of text can be ranked, (by likes or dislikes), and the most popular comments can float to the top of the comments for a particular section.
